#### ABOUT MY SELF
I am 21 years old, a software engineer from Minsk (Belarus). I'm interested in everything that's related to programming, from small projects that can be done alone to big projects, where the coherence and sociability of the whole team are important. I like to communicate with my colleagues at work, especially when it comes to solving complex problems. I will always offer an interesting idea in the discussion and listen to the thoughts of my colleagues and take them into account. I am very assiduous and stress-resistant, ready to perform any task. I always strive for the best. If you need such employees, I'm at your service.
